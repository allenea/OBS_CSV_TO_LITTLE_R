DISCLAIMER: 
If using this code or referencing it for your own project please acknowledge Eric Allen and the University of Delaware. This is research code. It may take some work to fit your needs.

The data-processing code for the Delaware and New Jersey Mesonet Data, NDBC, Local Climate Data, Mesowest, DelDOT, and more will be released after I have finished my thesis.

#### IMPORTANT #####

Directories/python programs:

The input data should be located in the root directory.

little_r_converter_v2.py is used to take all the data that has been processed, extracts the relevant data and creates the appropriate files. This program requires the met_em files.

OBS: This is where the outputs are located.
